# Roblox-Internals

A script designed for Roblox Internals. Currently only has Synapse X, am working on other Internals.

The script is open source and free to use

If you use my code to make your own projects please do the following:
--Dont Claim you wrote it, credit me.
--Make the code Open Source

The Script Editor is bad, this is a temporary solution until i get a better one.

Clear your Console if it is stuck, working on a solution.

NOTE TO THE SYNAPSE/ ROBLOX DEVS
1. This script is not designed for exploits or misuse. This script fully made in Luau and using its functions. This script was designed for Roblox Studio
2. If any Developers have issues with this being up, please dm me on discord: "@._._.__.___.____.".
3. i am NOT responsible for the user's actions with this Internal UI
4. This does not provide any unfair advantages as this Internal UI uses loadstring which is completely up to the developers if they wanna turn on loadstring or keep it off.
5. For any copyright issues, i will gladly rebrand the script, but i will not take it down unless something serious will (has?) happen that impacts Vulnerabilites, Exploits or Cheaters.
6. This Script is open source and will stay (?) open source.
7. If its used as an exploit, please contact the exploit provider and not me, i do not have anyting to do with Executors, Exploits or anything similar. I make Luau Scripts, nothing else which is perfectly legal and fine.
